STORAGE:
ebs is block storage for your application to use this hard disk block storage we need file system thats ext4 or more which format the block storage 

first you check the current block devices along with partition
lsblk 
fdisk -l    both use for block devices or to check partition but fdisk give more detailed info about partition (partision table)
df -T       to check file system
blkid       glabally unique partition or device id (bcz device name may cahnged once reboot)

now attach ebs volume to your instance 
then do lsblk you will see newly attached block device or volume
then we have to format the block storage with mkfs

mkfs -t <block device>    this format the block device mkfs -t /dev/xvdf
then mount it
mount <block device> <mount path>      this will mount the filesystem  mount /dev/xvdf /mnt/demo-volume

df -h                       to check diskspace overall
du -ah                      for perticular directory

PARTITION:
partition is a way to logically devide your disk in multiple part and you can asssign this partotion to diffrent directory,it encapsulate data means if something wrong with 1
partition it wont affect other partition.

parted /dev/xvda          to partition
its interactive
mklabel gpt
mkpart primary ext4 1MiB 5GiB    1ST partition from 1 mb to 5gb
mkpart primary ext4 5GiB 15GiB   2ND partition
quite    exit
sudo mkfs ext4 /dev/xvda1
sudo mkfs ext4 /dev/xvda2   thats it.
