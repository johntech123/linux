sbin: contain system binaries specilly for adminitrator not normal user like user-managment,reboot,shutdown,fdisk,mkfs,ifconfig
bin : system binaries for both root and user like cp mv ls cat echo mkdir
usr : it also contain system binaries which are not essential u have usr/bin ,usr/share:for common storage,usr/src:for storing source code
srv: is for server like webserver related config file we store here


process managment 
process is a running instance of your program like java application ,python or even a shell command is runs as process under the hood

ps -ef or ps aux                 view running process
ps aux | wc -l                   check number of process running     wc: word count -l   its L
diffrence between ps -f and ps aux 
ps -ef shows running process where ps aux show running process alonside the cpu & memory utilisation
top          check running process
htop         same only diffrence it give better vuisualisation colourful output nothing diffrent
top vs ps aux : top gives real time data it changes

kill pid
kill -9 pid
kill -STOP pid      to temporary stop the process
kill -CONT pid      to resume the process

renice:
renice is a command used to change the priority (or niceness) of a running process. It adjusts the "nice" value of a process, which influences how much CPU time it gets compared to other processes.

ðŸ§  What is "nice"?
The nice value is a number from -20 (highest priority) to 19 (lowest priority).

Default is usually 0.

Lower nice value = higher priority (gets more CPU time).

Higher nice value = lower priority (gets CPU time less aggressively).
-20 is lowest nice value = high cpu time
19 is highest nice value = less cpu time

renice -n 10 -p <pid>      -n number -p process id    less cpu time less priority
renice -n -7 -p <pid>       more priority more cpu time

service processs: which starts at the time of boot when your server goes down   like apache,nginx
systemctl list-units --type=service              This shows all active services.
systemctl list-units --type=service --all        List ALL services (active, inactive, enabled, disabled, etc.)
systemctl list-unit-files --type=service         systemctl list-unit-files --type=service

Type | Started by
Systemd service | Started and managed by systemd | Systemd starts services automatically at boot, or on demand | systemctl (start, stop, enable, etc.) | by defoult runs in background
Regular process | Started manually (e.g., via terminal or script) | Regular processes usually need a user to launch them | 	Commands like ps, kill, nice, top, etc | manually run background

systemd services:
Service name | What it does
ssh.service | Manages the SSH server
cron.service | Manages scheduled tasks
nginx.service | Manages the Nginx web server
networking.service | Manages network interfaces
mysql.service | Runs the MySQL database server

vmstat              to check the current state of linux server memory usage cpu usage overall system :   u know if someone ask about system low performance or slow
vmstat [delay] [count]
vmstat 2 5    in each 2 sec need update and 5 times
